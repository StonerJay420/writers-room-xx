# World Rules and Lore

## The Artifact
- Ancient device of unknown origin
- Responds only to specific bloodlines
- Can reveal hidden truths but at a cost
- Fragments scattered across three locations

## The Guardians
- Secret society established in 1823
- Each generation selects one keeper per bloodline
- Bound by oath to protect, never to use
- Knowledge passed through encrypted journals

## The Warehouse District
- Built over ancient ruins
- Natural dampening field for artifact energy
- Six hidden chambers, only three discovered
- Protected by both technology and tradition

## Rules of Engagement
1. The artifact cannot be destroyed, only contained
2. Direct contact triggers visions of possible futures
3. Prolonged exposure causes temporal displacement
4. Two bloodlines must be present to fully activate

## Consequences
- Each use of the artifact fractures reality slightly
- Visions become more vivid but less reliable over time
- The keeper always knows when the artifact is accessed

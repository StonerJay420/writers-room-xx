# Chapter 1, Scene 1

The rain drummed against the window as Sarah stared at her laptop screen. The cursor blinked mockingly at the end of an unfinished sentence. Three months since the accident, and still no words would come.

"Another coffee?" The barista's voice cut through her thoughts.

Sarah looked up, startled. "Oh, yes. Please."

The familiar ritual of ordering another latte gave her a moment's respite from the blank page. But as the barista moved away, the cursor resumed its relentless blinking, waiting for words that might never come.

# Chapter 1: The Discovery

Sarah's hands trembled as she opened the envelope. The paper inside was aged, yellowed at the edges, and bore a symbol she'd never seen beforeâ€”yet somehow felt familiar.

"This can't be real," she whispered, studying the intricate design. The office around her seemed to fade as the symbol drew her in, its curves and angles forming patterns that shouldn't make sense but somehow did.

The letter contained only three words: "Find the truth."

Below them, an address she recognized immediately. The old warehouse district. The place her grandfather had warned her never to visit.

She folded the letter carefully, her decision already made. Some warnings were meant to be ignored.

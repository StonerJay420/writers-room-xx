# Chapter 1, Scene 1

**POV:** Sarah Chen  
**Location:** Quantum Research Lab, MIT  
**Time:** 2:47 AM

The quantum entanglement chamber hummed with an eerie resonance that Sarah had never heard before. She'd been monitoring the particle accelerator for twelve hours straight, subsisting on nothing but cold coffee and determination. The equations dancing across her holographic displays were beginning to blur together, but she couldn't stop now.

"Computer, run diagnostic sequence gamma-seven," she commanded, her voice hoarse from disuse.

The AI's response crackled through the lab's speakers with unusual static. "Warning: Quantum coherence levels exceeding safety parameters by 247%. Recommend immediate shutdown."

Sarah's fingers flew across the haptic interface, adjusting the containment field parameters. The data streams showed consciousness patterns, actual neural signatures encoded in the quantum states.

"This is impossible," she whispered, but the evidence was undeniable.

# The Warehouse

Marcus had been watching the building for three hours when she arrived. Sarah Chen, looking exactly as he'd remembered—determined, curious, and completely unaware of the danger she was walking into.

He should have stopped her at the door. Should have explained everything. Instead, he followed her inside, keeping to the shadows as she navigated the maze of abandoned machinery and rusted shelves.

When she found the hidden panel—exactly where the letter must have indicated—he knew there was no going back. The secret his family had protected for generations was about to be exposed.

"You shouldn't be here," he said, stepping into the light.

Sarah spun around, her hand instinctively reaching for something in her pocket. The artifact, he realized. She already had it.

"Neither should you," she replied, her voice steadier than he expected.

They stood there, two inheritors of a mystery neither fully understood, while somewhere in the darkness, old gears began to turn.

# Chapter 1, Scene 2

The latte arrived with a perfect foam heart. Sarah's fingers wrapped around the warm ceramic, drawing comfort from its heat. She opened a new document, hoping a fresh start might break the spell.

*The accident changed everything,* she typed, then immediately deleted the words.

Too direct. Too painful.

She tried again: *It was a Tuesday when—* Delete.

*Marcus had always said—* Delete.

Her phone buzzed. A text from her editor: "How's the new book coming along?"

Sarah stared at the message, then at the blank screen. How could she explain that the words had died with Marcus that night on the interstate?

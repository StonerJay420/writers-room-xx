# Chapter 1, Scene 2

**POV:** Marcus Rivera  
**Location:** FBI Field Office, Boston  
**Time:** 3:15 AM

Marcus stared at the surveillance footage for the fifth time, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. Three different quantum research facilities, hundreds of miles apart, all experiencing the exact same anomaly at precisely 2:47 AM. It wasn't possible. It couldn't be coincidence.

"Agent Rivera," his partner Ellen called from across the room. "You need to see the MIT feed. Dr. Chen's lab."

The monitor showed Sarah, his ex-girlfriend, frantically working at her quantum chamber. He hadn't spoken to her in six months, not since their last fight about her obsessive research. Now he watched her on a grainy security feed, unaware that her experiment had triggered alerts in every intelligence agency in the country.

"Get me a team ready," Marcus ordered. "We're going to MIT. Now."
